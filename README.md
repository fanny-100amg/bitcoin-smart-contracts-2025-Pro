## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of the current state of crypto automation.

Let's be precise: **"Bitcoin-smart-contracts" is not a standard, widely adopted protocol that directly integrates with major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase for automated trading.** The landscape is more nuanced and fragmented.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how automated trading and portfolio management work in practice, and where smart contracts (primarily on Ethereum and other smart contract platforms) fit into this ecosystem.

---

### The Core Challenge: Centralized vs. Decentralized

The primary reason for the lack of direct integration is the fundamental difference between **Centralized Exchanges (CEXs)** like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, and **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** which is powered by smart contracts.

| Feature | Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) | DeFi & Smart Contracts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Control** | You trust the exchange with your funds (custodial). | You control your funds from your own wallet (non-custodial). |
| **Trading** | Uses a private, internal order book. Trades are IOU transactions
